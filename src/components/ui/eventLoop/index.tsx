          It manages the execution of our javascript programs. When we invoke a
          function, an execution context is created and pushed into the call
          stack. Because Stack is LIFO(Last In First Out) structure, it's
          execute the topmost function and after execution it's execution
          context is popped off the stack.
        </p>
        <p className="py-10">
          So in simple terms,when a function is invoked, it's gets pushed into
          the call stack, inside the stack, the function is executed line by
          line and after execution, it's gets popped out of the stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because JS is single threaded, once a function is pushed into the call
          stack, no other function can be pushed into the stack unless the
          current function has finished execution and it's popped off the stack.

              So outside the call stack, we have our beautiful world of the
              BROWSER.I personally feel that the browser is one of the greatest
              piece of technological inventions. Whether you are running on
              chrome, or safari, edge, firebox, you can't dispute the super
              power of the BROWSER.
            </p>
            <p className="py-8">
              The browser contains the JavaScript engine and Web APIs. Different
              browser uses different engines,from chrome and edge using v8, to
              firefox using SpiderMonkey and safari using Nitro.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enough of the browser glaze, what are web API?. Web API are
              browser-provided APIs that handle asynchronous operations like
              network requests, timers, and DOM events and so on.
            </p>
            <p className="py-8">
              Web APIs essentially act as a bridge between the JavaScript
              runtime and the browser features, allowing us to access
              information and use features beyond JavaScript's own capabilities

          <div>
            <p className="italic">"Web API and async tasks"</p>
            <p className="pt-4">
              Some web APIs (fetch, setTimeout,etc) can allow us to handle async
              operations by offloading the longer running task to the browser
              environment without waiting for it completion, and also set up
              handlers to handle the eventual completion of this task.
            </p>
            <p className="pt-3">
              After the async task has been initiaited, it's execution context
              is popped off the call stack. Web APIs that performs async tasks
              either use a callback-based or promise-based approach.

                  Take a look at the example we have above. We are using the
                  geolocation API which is a web API provided by the browser.
                </p>
                <p className="py-8">
                  when this function is invoked, a new execution context is
                  created and pushed into the call stack. The call stack now
                  delegates this operation to the browser's geolocation API. The
                  function of the call stack is just to "register" its callbacks
                  to the Web API, which then offloads the operation to the
                  browser. The function is then popped off the Call Stack; it's
                  now the browser's responsibility and now our call stack can
                  handle other tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  the browser prompts the user to give the website access to
                  their location. Once the user accepts, our website can now get
                  access to their location. The API now receives the data from
                  the browser, and uses the successCallback to handle the
                  result.
                </p>
                <p className="py-8">
                  However, the successCallback can't simply get pushed onto the
                  Call Stack, as doing so could potentially disrupt an already
                  running task.

              The Callback Queue is a FIFO data structure that holds the
              callbacks and event handlers of Web API. To simply put, when an
              async task finish executing, the callback is pushed into the task
              queue which will be picked up by the Event Loop and pushed into

              Web API process this action and returns a callback function. The
              callback is sent to the Callback Queue. When the Call Stack is
              empty the Event Loop push the callback to the Call Stack for
              execution.

              JavaScript runtime gives higher priority to tasks in the micro
              queue than the callback queue. Web APIs like fetch,
              mutationObserver, queueMicrotask return a promise object which
              contain [[promiseState]], [[promiseResult]] and other records. The
              [[promiseResult]] which contains the data are sent to the micro
              task queue to be handled by promise handler (.then, .catch, async
              await).
            </p>

            <p className="py-6">
              To simply put, when the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop pushes
              all the Micro Tasks [[promiseResults]] to the Call Stack for
              execution before attending to the tasks in the Callback Queue.
            </p>

            <p className="py-6">
              Note:Microtasks can also schedule other microtasks! This could
              lead to infinite microtask loop, causing a starvation and delay of
              the Callback Queue indefinitely and freezing the rest of the
              program. So be careful!.
            </p>

            <p>
              Such a scenario cannot (!) happen on the Task Queue. The Event
              Loop processes tasks on the Task Queue one by one, then it "starts
              over" by checking the Microtask Queue.
            </p>
            <p className="py-6">
              Let's take a look at a popular promise-based API called fetch.
              When we invoke fetch, its execution context is created and added
              to the Call Stack. Calling fetch creates a Promise Object in
              memory which include [[promiseState]] "pending" and
              [[promiseResult]] "undefined" by default.
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              After initiating the network request, the fetch function call is
              popped off the Call Stack. The JS engine now encounters the
              chained then/catch handler. When the server finally returns the
              data, the [[PromiseState]] is set to "fulfilled" , the
              [[PromiseResult]] is set to the Response object.
            </p>
            <p className="py-6">
              As the promise resolves, the PromiseReaction is pushed onto the
              Microtask Queue. When the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop
              moves the handler callback from the Microtask Queue onto the the
              Call Stack, where it's executed, and eventually popped off the
              call stack.

              allows JavaScript to handle multiple tasks concurrently, without
